### Project Title

**Author**

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
There is a demand in automation or manufacturing to predict when machines will need maintenance. The goal is the create software to predict maintenance to avaoid failure during production, preveting downtime and increasing production time.

#### Research Question
How to predict mode of failure of machine, and when it may occur therefore allowing technicians to perform necessary maintenance before actual failure.

#### Data Sources
- This is the data source:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification

#### Methodology
- I performed the following:
  - Logistic Rregression
  - SVM
  - Decision Tree
  and compared results.
#### Results
- Tests confirmed the that heat dissipation failures were the most prominent and     correlated with obvious factors including ambient and process temperatures. However, total wear was also a leading factor.

#### Next steps
- Use a dataset with more detailed information of events before a failure. This will better determine the relationship between failure and machine operation.
